## Usage Examples

### Document RAG
```python
# Agent can now index your entire document collection
agent.call("build-index", {
  "index_name": "my-papers",
  "docs": ["./research/", "./notes/"]
})

# Then search semantically
results = agent.call("search-documents", {
  "index_name": "my-papers",
  "query": "neural network optimization"
})

# Or ask questions
answer = agent.call("ask-question", {
  "index_name": "my-papers",
  "question": "How do you implement selective recomputation?"
})
```

## Platform Features

### Windows + WSL Support
- ‚úÖ **CLI Interface**: Fully functional on Windows
- ‚úÖ **Text Search Fallback**: Robust fallback when vector backends fail
- ‚úÖ **WSL2 Integration**: Full vector search and advanced features via WSL2
- ‚úÖ **Smart Runtime Selection**: Automatically uses WSL when available for optimal performance

### Linux/macOS
- ‚úÖ **Complete Support**: All features available including vector operations

### New Advanced Features
- üéØ **Semantic Codebase Analysis**: Intelligent architecture, function, and class analysis
- üîç **Code Intelligence**: Automatic extraction of patterns and documentation quality
- üìä **Fallback Analytics**: Basic analysis even without vector search

## MCP Integration Status

LEANN is now fully integrated as an MCP server:
- Added to `config/mcp_tools.json`
- Plugin executor handles LEANN commands
- Available alongside existing tools (search, browser, news, etc.)

The agent can now use LEANN whenever document search or RAG capabilities are needed to provide more accurate and contextually relevant responses.

## Architecture Benefits
- **Selective Recomputation**: Only computes embeddings during search, not storage
- **Graph-based Pruning**: High-degree preserving graph structure minimizes memory usage
- **Dynamic Batching**: Efficient GPU utilization for embedding computations
- **AST-aware Chunking**: Code-aware document splitting for better code understanding
