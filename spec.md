# Feature Specification: Modular CLI AI Agent with MCP Integration

**Feature Branch**: `001-modular-ai-agent`  
**Created**: 2025-09-30  
**Status**: Ready for Planning  
**Input**: User description: "Build an AI agent that can be ran in the terminal and api base url, use the tools of spec kit to design an agent that can have mcp tools added extremely easily and fast without errors, simple yet extremely sophisticated ai agent with local memory and modular"

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
A developer launches the AI agent in the terminal to handle tasks like code generation or system queries. The agent converses interactively, uses the configured AI model for reasoning, automatically applies relevant MCP tools from a simple config file, and remembers previous interactions across sessions for context-aware responses.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the agent is launched in terminal with required .env, **When** user enters a task description, **Then** the agent starts an interactive session and responds using the AI model.
2. **Given** MCP tools are defined in a config file, **When** the task requires a tool (e.g., file read or command exec), **Then** the agent loads and uses the tool seamlessly without setup errors.
3. **Given** a previous session exists, **When** the agent is relaunched, **Then** it recalls and incorporates stored context (e.g., conversation history, task state).
4. **Given** a new MCP tool is added to the config, **When** the agent restarts, **Then** the tool is immediately available without code changes or errors.
5. **Given** an invalid task input, **When** processed, **Then** the agent provides helpful error feedback and suggests clarifications.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when no MCP tools match the task? The agent should fall back to pure AI reasoning or ask for clarification.
- How does the system handle API connection failures? It should retry or notify the user without crashing the session.
- What if local memory storage is full or inaccessible? The agent should warn and operate in memory-only mode.
- How does the agent manage concurrent tool calls? It should sequence them reliably without race conditions.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The agent MUST provide a terminal-based interactive command-line interface for starting conversations and inputting tasks.
- **FR-002**: The agent MUST connect to an external AI API using environment variables for key and base URL to enable model-based reasoning.
- **FR-003**: The agent MUST support loading and executing MCP tools from a user-editable configuration file, allowing addition without restarting or modifying core code.
- **FR-004**: The agent MUST maintain local persistent storage for session state, conversation history, and task context across multiple runs.
- **FR-005**: The agent MUST allow modular extension for new tools, memory backends, or models via configuration or plugins, ensuring changes are fast and error-free.
- **FR-006**: The agent MUST handle tool execution errors gracefully, providing user-friendly feedback and fallback options.
- **FR-007**: The agent MUST support task completion signals, such as summarizing results or exporting outputs (e.g., files, commands).

### Key Entities
- **Session**: Represents an ongoing user interaction, including history, current task, and loaded tools.
- **MCP Tool**: A configurable capability (e.g., file ops, API calls) defined by name, parameters, and MCP server details for dynamic loading.
- **Local Memory Store**: Persistent record of sessions, with entries for timestamps, user inputs, agent responses, and tool outcomes.
