# Autonomous Agent with Full Tool Access

This guide explains how the MCP AI Agent has been configured for full autonomous tool usage.

## Problem Statement

The agent was previously limited to hardcoded RSS feeds and couldn't:
- Browse arbitrary news websites
- Extract content from any URL the user requested
- Autonomously decide which tool to use for a given task

## Solution Overview

The agent now has a ReAct-style (Reasoning + Acting) architecture that:

1. **Receives available tool descriptions** in system context
2. **Autonomously decides** which tools to use
3. **Executes tools** based on its decisions
4. **Processes results** and provides informed responses

## Available Tools

### News & Web Browsing
- **browse-url**: Navigate to ANY website and extract content
- **browser-extract-smart**: Intelligently extract main content
- **crawl**: Deep crawl with clean markdown extraction
- **fetch-news**: RSS-based news (fallback for when sites block crawling)

### Time & Utilities
- **get-time**: Current time
- **get-date**: Current date
- **get-day-info**: Day of week, etc.

### File Operations
- **read-file**: Read local files
- **list-dir**: List directory contents

## How It Works

### Step 1: User Request
```
User: "Show me the latest news from CNN"
```

### Step 2: Agent Reasoning
Agent sees available tools and decides to use `browse-url` to visit CNN.com

### Step 3: Tool Execution
System executes browse-url with URL: https://www.cnn.com

### Step 4: Result Processing
Agent receives extracted content and presents formatted news to user

## Key Features

### Full Autonomy
- Agent decides which tool to use
- Not limited to predefined RSS feeds
- Can browse ANY website

### Intelligent Fallbacks
- If browsing is blocked, tries RSS feeds
- If one approach fails, tries another
- Always attempts to fulfill the user's request

### Location-Specific News
Even with full autonomy, the agent can still leverage curated feeds:
- Seattle, Washington
- St. Louis, Missouri
- Miami, Florida
- New York, NY
- And more...

## Usage Examples

```
"Show latest news from BBC" â†’ Browses bbc.com
"What's happening in Seattle?" â†’ Uses Seattle RSS OR browses local news sites
"Latest robotics news" â†’ Uses robotics RSS feeds
"Show me CNN headlines" â†’ Browses CNN.com directly
"News about [any topic]" â†’ Agent decides best approach
```

## Technical Implementation

### System Prompt (in web_ui.py)
The agent receives clear tool descriptions and usage instructions in every interaction.

### Tool Request Format
LLM can request tools using natural language or structured format.

### Execution Flow
1. User message â†’ Agent reasoning
2. Agent requests tool(s)
3. Tools execute, return results
4. Results fed back to agent
5. Agent provides final answer

## Debugging

Check server logs for:
```
ðŸŽ¯ DETECTED TOPIC: [topic] from query: [query]
ðŸ“° NEWS CONTEXT SENT TO LLM: [details]
```

This shows what the agent detected and what data it's working with.

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Multi-step tool chaining
- [ ] Image/video content extraction
- [ ] PDF parsing
- [ ] API integrations (Twitter, Reddit, etc.)
- [ ] Database queries

## Notes

- RSS feeds are still valuable for consistent, reliable news
- Browser tools provide flexibility for any website
- Agent chooses the best tool for each specific request
- Timeout increased to 120s for complex operations
